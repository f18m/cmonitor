/*
 * prometheus_gauge.h -- code for collecting prometheus gauge metrics
 * Developer: Satyabrata Bharati.

 *  Description:
 Defines PrometheusGauge class which creates and maintains "prometheus::Family<prometheus::Gauge>" and
 "prometheus::Gauge" class reference for each kpi with type "GAUGE".
 One object of PrometheusGauge class gets created per KPI, during application startup.

 prometheus::Family<prometheus::Gauge> :
 This class creates a new metric of type prometheus::Gauge.
 Every metric is uniquely identified by its name and a set of key-value pairs, also known as labels.
 Prometheus's query language allows filtering and aggregation based on metric name and these labels.
 Each new set of labels adds a new dimensional data and is exposed in Prometheus as a time series.
 It is possible to filter the time series with Prometheus's query language by appending a set of labels to match in
 curly braces ({}).

 * prometheus::Gauge :
 This class represents the metric type gauge whose value can arbitrarily go up and down.
