 *  Description:
 Defines PrometheusCounter class which creates and maintains "prometheus::Family<prometheus::Counter>" and
 "prometheus::Counter" class reference for each KPI.
 One object of PrometheusCounter class gets created per KPI, during application startup.

 prometheus::Family<prometheus::Counter> :
 This class creates a new metric of type prometheus::Counter.
 Every metric is uniquely identified by its name and a set of key-value pairs, also known as labels.
 Prometheus's query language allows filtering and aggregation based on metric name and these labels.
 Each new set of labels adds a new dimensional data and is exposed in Prometheus as a time series.
 It is possible to filter the time series with Prometheus's query language by appending a set of labels to match in
 curly braces ({}).

 prometheus::Counter :
 This class represents the metric type counter whose value can only increase.
