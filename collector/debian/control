Description: a container performance monitoring solution
 A Docker/LXC, database-free, lightweight container performance monitoring solution, perfect for ephemeral containers
 (e.g. containers used for DevOps automatic testing). Can also be used with InfluxDB and Grafana to monitor long-lived 
 containers in real-time.
