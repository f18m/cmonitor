# Conanfile to retrieve prometheus-cpp library (and its dependencies/*: civetweb, openssl, libcurl)
# This Conanfile is used also by COPR during RPM creation.
#

[requires]
  # prometheus-cpp 1.1.0 cannot be used because it supports only C++14 onward; however the compiler shipping with Centos7
  # supports at most the C++11 dialect... so till we want to support Centos7, we need to stick with prometheus-cpp 1.0.0
  prometheus-cpp/1.2.4@
