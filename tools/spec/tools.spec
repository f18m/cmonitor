%description
Tools to post-process data collected via cmonitor_collector utility.
Cmonitor collector is  a Docker/LXC, database-free, lightweight container performance monitoring solution, perfect for ephemeral containers
(e.g. containers used for DevOps automatic testing). Can also be used with InfluxDB and Grafana to monitor long-lived 
containers in real-time.
